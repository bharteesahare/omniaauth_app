To add OAuth Google login to a Rails 7 application, you can follow these general steps:

Create a new project in the Google Developers Console:

Go to https://console.developers.google.com/
Create a new project by clicking on the "Select a project" dropdown menu in the top bar, then "New Project".
Give your project a name and click "Create".
Configure the OAuth consent screen:

Select your project in the top bar and go to "OAuth consent screen" on the left sidebar.
Choose the "External" user type and fill out the required information (app name, support email, etc.).
Under "Scopes for Google APIs", add the "openid" and "email" scopes.
Add any additional scopes your app requires, depending on what you want to do with the user's Google data.
Create credentials:

Still in the Google Developers Console, select your project and go to "Credentials" on the left sidebar.
Click "Create credentials" and choose "OAuth client ID".
Select "Web application" as the application type.
Add a name for your OAuth client ID.
Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add the callback URL for your Rails app's OAuth callback route. This will typically be something like https://yourapp.com/auth/google_oauth2/callback.
Click "Create" to generate your client ID and secret.
Add the omniauth-google-oauth2 gem to your Rails app's Gemfile:

python
Copy code
gem 'omniauth-google-oauth2'
Set up OmniAuth in your Rails app:

Create a new file config/initializers/omniauth.rb with the following code:
ruby
Copy code
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :google_oauth2, 'GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID', 'GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET', {
    scope: 'openid email', # additional scopes can be added here
    prompt: 'select_account',
    image_aspect_ratio: 'square',
    image_size: 50
  }
end
Replace GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET with the actual values for your app.
Create an OAuth callback route in your Rails app:

In config/routes.rb, add a route for the callback:
csharp
Copy code
get '/auth/:provider/callback', to: 'sessions#create'
This assumes you have a SessionsController with a create action that handles the OAuth callback.
Create the SessionsController and the create action:

In app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb, create a create action like this:
ruby
Copy code
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    user = User.from_omniauth(request.env['omniauth.auth'])
    session[:user_id] = user.id
    redirect_to root_path
  end
end
This assumes you have a User model with a from_omniauth class method that creates or finds a user based on the OAuth data.
Add a login button to your app:

In your view, add a link or button to the Google OAuth login page:
python
Copy code
<%= link_to "Sign in with Google", "/auth/google_oauth2" %>
This will initiate the OAuth flow when clicked, and redirect to the callback route you defined.
That's it! Your Rails 7 app should now allow users to sign in with Google using OAuth.
